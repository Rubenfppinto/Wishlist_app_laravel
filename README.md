The aim was to build a plataform where the users could have all their wanted items in one place. This was simply learning project for myself to get familiar with Laravel which uses concepts such as MVC, CRUD, restfull routes, databases, blades, authentication, authorization and others, and therefore I tried to keep it simple.
